# Letter/Symbol Finder Game

This is a simple browser game built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The game involves finding all occurrences of a specified letter or symbol from a grid of random characters. The game has two levels: easy and hard. When the user completes the easy level, they can choose the topic (letter or symbol) for the next level. The game is compatible with many screens including desktop, tablet, and mobile.
